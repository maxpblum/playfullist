Current version: 0.0.2

This is a simple Chrome extension for playing all of the embedded Youtube videos on a single web page back-to-back. It creates a toolbar button that toggles a panel in which the videos play. Currently it only works on pages whose videos are all in `<iframe>` tags and share a common HTML class, but it can be adapted easily by changing the `findVideos` method (and any Pull Requests that improve on that function are very welcome). Enjoy!

The easiest way to install the extension is via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/playfullist/dfibeojaonokcgmgdmakkipgnfieclfn) (free)
